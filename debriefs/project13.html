<h3>What made us smile</h3>
<li>
    Once Mike configured the gatway accounts with the specific methods, they showed up right away without any extra configuration needed.
</li>

<h3>What was confusing, did you encounter any issues?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        For a beginner the difference between merchant account, gateway account, payment method is confusing. There are some explications in the docs, and glossary. However for example if we google "Rebilly add a payment method" we end up on this FramePay page which is quite confusing for a novice https://www.rebilly.com/docs/dev-docs/setup-multiple-payment-methods.
    </li>
    <li>
        Search results were not great. API search is fine but searching the documentation doesn't provide helpful results.

    <li>
        Actually using ChatGPT gave much better results than the search bar on the Rebilly website.

    <li>
        Mike ended up using Stripe "resources" (not categorized as docs) to get some clarity on the difference between merchant account, gateway account, payment method. https://stripe.com/en-ca/resources/more/payment-gateways-101
    </li>
    <li>
        Mike had to realize that configuring the payment methods would be done in the "gateway account" section.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once Mike was configuring the gateways, it was not clear if he should select Skrill gateway in sandbox mode, or TestProcessor with Skrill method.
    </li>
    <li>
        When configuring the gateway account, the list of payment methods was very long with options like `bank-transfer-2`, `bank-transfer-3` etc. What are these?
    </li>
    <li>
        The payment methods showed up properly, but only credit card worked. For the others we got an error "Rebilly Instruments Error"
